# The Deep Jobs and Missions, Archeaology Missions, and There Might Be Riots
 ## Or How to Aquire a City Ship License
A WIP guide I'm working on after being dissatisfied with results on the Internet that had wrong, outdated, or conflicting information on how to obtain a City Ship License. This is accurate for version 0.9.12 and possibly others.

Information in this guide comes directly from the mission files and my own experience.
